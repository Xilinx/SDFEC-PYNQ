    "The ZCU111 has 8 SD-FEC integrated blocks that we can use to enable our RF systems to function under non-ideal, noisy environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SD-FEC blocks support Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) decoding and encoding, as well as the turbo code decoding used in LTE. We'll focus on LDPC codes for now since we can encode *and* decode these using a SD-FEC block. These codes are configurable from software, as we'll see [later](#Comparing-LDPC-codes).\n",
    "\n",
    "An LDPC code is a form of parity check matrix. Let's take a look at a graphical representation of what this means:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](assets/ldpc_fourney.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the row of `=` blocks represent the original data bits, the `+` blocks represent the parity bits, and the code dictates the number of blocks and their interconnects.\n",
    "Note that most data bits contribute to multiple parity bits. Upon detecting error(s), multiple parity bits can be used to iteratively retrieve the original data. This iterative decode process can terminate early if we detect a valid codeword.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some further reading on LDPC codes, take a look at Bernhard M.J. Leiner's excellent [tutorial](http://www.bernh.net/media/download/papers/ldpc.pdf). You might want to save this reading for later though — some of our upcoming SD-FEC tests take a few minutes to execute!\n",
